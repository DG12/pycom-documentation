### Take into consideration

* If you are using iOS 12, turn off your Wi-Fi completely on your iPhone.
* Use only Wi-Fi network with 2.4GHz (Pycom devices cannot connect to 5GHz network)
* Your device might be provisioned faster if you move your device closer to your Wi-Fi router.
* Make sure your devices are powered on and running firmware 1.20.1 or newer.
* You cannot provision the same devices on the different Pybytes accounts unless you erased the flash memory of them before provisioning.
* Provisioning is in the process only if you see the spinner on the screen. If it’s disappeared, then you need to try to provision again.
* Please, take into account, that we are developing a new feature, therefore some challenges could happen. Let us know about any issue that happened while using Pybytes iOS <a href="mailto:support@pycom.io">support@pycom.io</a>.

* First, check the version of iOS that you have. If it is iOS 12 then turn off completely the Wi-Fi connection on your phone and after try to use Pybytes iOS again for connecting to Wi-Fi.

* If you have a later than 12 version of iOS then check (how to check) your Wi-Fi router setting. It should run 2.4 HGz Wi-Fi network.
