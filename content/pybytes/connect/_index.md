Select how you would like to connect your device to Pybytes:

1. [Connect your device quickly (Recommended)](quick)

{{% refname "quick.md" %}}

2. [Connect your device by flashing Pybytes Library](flash)

{{% refname "flash.md" %}}

From firmware 1.16.x onwards all Pycom devices come with Pybytes library built-in `/frozen` folder. That means that you can choose between adding your device quickly with the firmware updater or you can flash Pybytes library manually.
