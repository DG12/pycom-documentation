## Pyscan Libraries

* Pyscan libraries to use the RFID/NFC reader are located [here](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/tree/master/pyscan)
* The accelerometer library is [here](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/blob/master/pytrack/lib/LIS2HH12.py)

{{{% hint style="info" %}}}
For the time being, we recommend to upload the `MFRC630.mpy` file via FTP due to current limitations of Pymakr that will be fixed shortly.
